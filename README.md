# MuMeRNN

This project is the foundation for the paper:
Real-valued parametric conditioning of an RNN for interactive sound synthesis,  6th International Workshop on Musical Metacreation, International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC) June 25-26, 2018, Salamanca, Spain
Link: <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10808.pdf>


It is an ipothon notebook developed in PyTorch. 

## Getting Started

Set the parameters in the first cell, then run.
To use the cannonical parameters for generating images and sounds for the paper, set:
 'batch_size' : 256,
 'epoch_limit': 10000


### Prerequisites

You'll need an environment with installed libraries:
librosa
ipywidgets
